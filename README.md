## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The IkeNei follows a layered architecture pattern:

1. **Presentation Layer** (`frontend/`) - User interface and user experience
2. **Business Logic Layer** (`backend/`) - API endpoints, business rules, and data processing
3. **Data Layer** (`database/`) - Data storage, retrieval, and management
4. **Shared Layer** (`shared/`) - Common utilities, types, and constants
5. **Testing Layer** (`tests/`) - Comprehensive test coverage
6. **Documentation Layer** (`docs/`) - Technical specifications and guides

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

- **Data Encryption**: All data encrypted in transit and at rest
- **Privacy Compliance**: GDPR and other privacy regulation compliant
- **Anonymous Feedback**: Option for completely anonymous feedback submission
- **Access Controls**: Strict role-based access to sensitive information
- **Audit Trails**: Complete logging of all system activities

## 🧪 Development Guidelines

- Each layer should be loosely coupled and highly cohesive
- Use the shared directory for code that needs to be used across multiple layers
- Follow consistent naming conventions across all directories
- Maintain comprehensive test coverage for all business logic
- Document all APIs and architectural decisions
